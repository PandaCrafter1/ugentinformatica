LaTeX is a document markup language and document preparation system 
for the TeX typesetting program. It is widely used by mathematicians, 
scientists, philosophers, engineers, and scholars in academia and the 
commercial world, and by others as a primary or intermediate format 
(e.g. translating DocBook and other XML-based formats to PDF) because 
of the quality of typesetting achievable by TeX. It offers programmable 
desktop publishing features and extensive facilities for automating most 
aspects of typesetting and desktop publishing, including numbering 
and cross-referencing, tables and figures, page layout and 
bibliographies.

LaTeX is intended to provide a high-level language to access the 
power of TeX. LaTeX essentially comprises a collection of TeX macros, 
and a program to process LaTeX documents. Since TeX's formatting 
commands are very low-level, it is usually much simpler for 
end-users to use LaTeX. LaTeX was originally written in 1984 by 
Leslie Lamport at SRI International and has become the dominant 
method for using TeX. Few people write in plain TeX anymore. Like TeX, 
LaTeX is free software.

Samson & Gert zetten eindelijk de stap naar het witte doek! In hun 
eerste film zien Samson & Gert hun vakantieplannen in rook opgaan. 
Het oude hotel van de opa van Marleneke dreigt afgebroken te worden 
als het niet dringend vernieuwd wordt. Samson en Gert starten vol 
goede moed met de renovatie, met de hulp van hun trouwe maar onhandige 
vrienden. Wat ze echter niet weten, is dat twee boeven ooit hun buit 
hebben verstopt in het gebouw. Wanneer de twee schurken de gevangenis 
verlaten, willen ze maar een ding: hun schat ophalen. Maar dat is buiten 
Samson & Gert gerekend...voor ze het beseffen, belanden ze in een 
knotsgek avontuur!

De Dalai Lama van Tibet is de hoogste spirituele leider in het Tibetaans
Boeddhisme. De Tibetanen noemen hem ook wel Yishin Norbu.

Vroeger was hij ook de hoogste politieke leider van Tibet. Tegenwoordig 
staat Tibet onder Chinees bewind, sinds de invasie van het Chinese leger 
onder Mao Zedong in 1951. Door Tibetanen en velen wereldwijd wordt dit 
bewind niet erkend en wordt de Dalai Lama nog steeds als de politieke 
leider van Tibet beschouwd. Hij behoort tot de jongste en grootste 
van de vier Tibetaanse Boeddhistische scholen, de Gelug-traditie. Tot 
dezelfde school behoort de Panchen Lama.

Dear Friend, 

I wish to approach you with a request that would be of immense benefit to 
both of us. I am an attorney based in Scotland United Kingdom. I want you 
and I to make some fortune out of a situation that I am obviously left 
with no other better option. The issue that I am presenting to you is a 
case of my client that willed a fortune to his only daughter. It is 
unfortunate that he and his daughter died on the London Bomb attacks on 7 
July 2005. The wife died of heart attack on receiving the sad news a week 
after. I am now faced with a problem of getting a trusted person who I 
will make the beneficiary that I would pass the fortune to. And according 
to the law such fortune is supposed to be bequeathed to the government if 
there is not any relatives or next-of-kin of the decease that would 
surface for claim of the fortune.

However, I personally dont belong to such school of thought that proposes 
that such fortune be given to the government because this is cheating and 
is possible that the top government officials for their own selfish 
interest could divert the fortune. Because of this I am contacting you to 
seek your acting as the beneficiary of the will. I am my client attorney 
and I alone knew about his will. Upon indication of your interests, all I 
will do is to amend the will by fitting in your name as the supposed 
next-of-kin and back it up with a sworn affidavit, which automatically 
became valid. This amendment should be between us and must not leak out to 
anyone. It is absolutely confidential.

I have complete information of his bank account details with an 
outstanding balance of $48,550,000.00USD ($48.550 Million USD). To make 
you be sure of this, I can provide you with details of his bank to enable 
you to log on to his account to confirm this balance. I know that you 
would be apprehensive and feel that this is a big sum, but it does not 
matter because this is a legacy being passed on to a next-of-kin and you 
are the available next-of-kin.

As I am not very sure of getting your consent yet on the issue, I prefer 
not to divulge my full identity so as not to risk being disbarred. Until I 
am sure of your consent and full cooperation then I will not be afraid to 
give you my full identity. In the meanwhile, I would prefer that we 
maintain correspondence by email and fax. At this point I want to assure 
you that your true consent, full cooperation and confidentiality are all 
that are required to enable us to take full advantage of this golden 
opportunity.

I shall make representation to the legal courts to facilitate the 
amendment process within three working days. Since this is a transaction 
of immense benefit to both of us, I would want that we shared all expenses 
according to our agreed sharing ratio of the fortune. The sharing ratio 
shall be 60% for me and 40% for you. This shall also be applicable to all 
expenditures that would be incurred in the course of the transaction 
because I wouldn?t want either of us to feel cheated. Please note that 
this is a legal and risk free transaction that does not in anyway hamper 
the monetary laws of your country. It is an inheritance fund.

If you are interested to work with me, please provide me with your name, 
address, nationality, age, and date of birth, height, and phone and fax 
numbers as required for the amendment of the WILL. On completion of this, 
I will send you a copy of the amended WILL which you will fax to the bank 
with a back up letter written by your good self requesting for the release 
of the fund to you. I will also write to the bank as the legal 
representative of my client before his demise, ordering for the transfer 
of the fund to you, as the beneficiary of his will.

I will appreciate your urgent response in this regard. Thanks for your 
anticipated cooperation.You can as well reach me on mudoock@walla.com

Yours faithfully, 
Kirk Murdock.
